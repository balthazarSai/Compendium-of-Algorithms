# Algorithms & Data Structures

I am currently studying CS and also teaching a study group for people coming in for the first course Algorithms & Data Structures. 

As most of the teaching is done in pseudocode, I decided that it'd be helpful for new students to be able to have a code implementation as a reference as well, so I wrote the pertinent ones in Java, along with a simple terminal interface, and posted them here.

## Disclaimer
I tried to implement these as basic as posible without using that many external packages, as such they might not be the best implementations out there but I hope they will be helpful.

## WIP
I haven't implemented all the functionality yet, and some of the documentation is missing, I will be updating soon. If I have time I will add more implementations in other languages and perhaps a few more algorithms.
